## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic Operations**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Advanced Functions**:
  - Trigonometric functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`.
  - Logarithmic functions: `log` (base-10), `ln` (natural logarithm).
  - **Square Root**: Calculate square roots using the `√` button.
- **Constants**: Includes Pi (`π`) and Euler's number (`e`).
- **Parentheses Support**: Use parentheses `(` and `)` for grouping expressions.
- **Decimal Numbers**: Supports decimal calculations using the `.` button.
- **Error Handling**: Displays `Error` for invalid expressions.
- **Secure Evaluation**: Safely evaluates mathematical expressions using a restricted `eval`.
- **Extensible**: The calculator can easily be extended with new features and functions.

## Usage

1. **Launch the application**:

   Run `calculator.py` using Python 3 to start the calculator.

2. **Perform basic operations**:

   - Use number buttons (`0`-`9`) to input numbers.
   - Use arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) for calculations.

3. **Use advanced functions**:

   - **Trigonometric functions**: Click `sin`, `cos`, or `tan` and enter values in radians.
   - **Logarithms**: Click `log` for base-10 logarithms or `ln` for natural logarithms.
   - **Square root**: Use the `√` button to calculate square roots.

4. **Calculate the result**:

   After entering the expression, press `=` to evaluate the result.

5. **Clear input**:

   Use the `C` button to clear the current input.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: The calculator app requires Python 3 to run.
- **tkinter**: The standard Python GUI toolkit, usually included with Python installations.
